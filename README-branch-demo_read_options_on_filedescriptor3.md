# Regarding git branch demo_read_options_on_filedescriptor3

Just trying out an approach. This is not so important.

When libpod Github issue [Add support for --preserve-fds to podman run](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/6458)
has been implemented, maybe it makes some sense to let the command `demo` read the 
options-input on file decriptor 3 instead of from a specified file path.
